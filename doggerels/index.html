<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Moments</strong></p>

<p>I open and close doors,<br />
in front of and behind me.<br />
Cigarettes.<br />
Slumbery steps to<br />
the mounted ashtray.<br />
The smoke escapes<br />
from my lungs.<br />
Only these creased<br />
mementos remain,<br />
building up and squeezed<br />
ill-fitting in the box.<br />
Caged moments.<br />
My throat is empty.<br />
Words are rolling back<br />
from the mouth,<br />
piling up.<br />
Once again<br />
I inhale.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Morning Swim</strong></p>
               
<p>Standing yet.<br />
The shore runs away from your feet,<br />
to home, under the duvet of blueness.<br />
Lay your chest against where water ends.<br />
Before dawn, with sky it comes to rest;<br />
seeking until their breath into one blends.<br />
Stride after stride relentless you push<br />
along the seam of separated hues.<br />
Undulating disquiet between blues.<br />
Your head bowing and raising anew midst<br />
slipping fingers of water fraying to mist.<br />
Empty fall they back, thirsty air still desist.<br />
Forgotten the coast, where they are bound,<br />
you keep swimming.<br /><p />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Sorrow</strong></p>

<p>Black bird! Come, cover me with your feathers!<br />
Shadow me from the mischevous light.<br />
Dragging clouds thus not promise me the sun.<br />
Let your wings be my tent of sturdy canvas. <br />
When snow constructs empire on all that living;  <br />
exhale your warmth under my skin, like lovers'<br />
heartbeat through scented chest enchanted.<br />
Give me the comfort of half closed drawers, <br />
the invitation of shadows sitting behind doors,<br />
around a unlit candle burnt its bent history.<br />
Plug your plumag's grey wax into my ears.<br />
In your beak, to the tree from where hunters<br />
in their quieted follies are seen, take me.<br />
I will not sense cold, wait not for spring.<br />
I will be sat in silence as my feathers grow.<br /><p />

<p>&nbsp;</p>        
<p><strong>Sum</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em> To J. M-W.</em> <p/>
<p>Loop of dust. <br />
On the ground. <br />
Around God's finger. <br /></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Idling</strong></p>

<p>Along angled course <br />
let the flies dash around <br />
cutting the sluggish air <br />
in to pre-thought shards. <br /> </p>

<p>To discover the continent, <br />
that is my rugged cheeks, <br />
eager wings do not relent. <br />
Million flaps never cease. <br /> </p>

<p>Leaning against the wind <br />
they are sailing to my face. <br />
Head is rested on a plaid; <br />
above stretches a tree. <br /> </p>

<p>Branches yawning circles <br />
into their stacked shadow. <br />
Caring not 'tis the air rises <br />
or they are pushed below. <br /> </p>

<p>Flowing over sleepy fronds, <br /> 
listless light, lukewarm, <br />
in a careless, yielding nod,<br />
to drops it is gently torn. <br /> </p>

<p>I am not even watching. <br />
Letting rays fall upon my eyes. <br />
Some glancing, some sinking <br />
in the water that below lies. <br /> </p>

<p>Twin lakes, motionless they stay. <br />
Through once unknown shores  <br />
Ancient breeze is fading away. <br /> </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Chinguetti</strong></p>
 
<p>Ratchet of prayers 'cross the fence. <br />
Buzzing of flies upon my ears. <br />
Aimless wind rises to wash it all away <br /></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Funafuti</strong></p>

<p>Any news from the island?<br /><br /></p>
<p>Numb limbs of sky resting,<br />far, they fold in the waters.<br /><br /></p>
<p>Speckles of ships on the horizon?<br /><br /></p>
<p>Molten glass trembles,<br />weighs upon the ocean.<br /><br /></p>
<p>Blares forgotten their horns?<br /><br /></p>
<p>Faded wind whimpers<br />between my fingers.<br /><br /></p>
<p>Have not I been drawing<br />lines in the sand?<br /><br /></p>
<p>Palm trees press their<br />shadows on the shore.<br /><br /></p>
<p>Any news from the island?<br /><br /></p>
<p>Be calm. The sea will<br />
rise and recede again.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Figurine</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>To S.K.</em></p>
<p>Exhaled the heat,<br />
lungs are closed now<br />
in tightened metal chest.<br />
Off her skin,<br />
last layers of warmth that<br />
had never been hers<br />
peeled and forgotten.<br />
Shadow of the never finished<br />
movement surrounds her<br />
like fallen soldiers sleep.<br />
Still.<br />
Mellow sun trickles between<br />
her fingers poking towards it.<br />
By restless muscles<br />
arms are bending.<br />
And she raises her legs and<br />
dances, dances in the light!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Journey</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>To R.W.</em></p>
<p>You wonder<br />
the days,<br />
yester:<br />
jester and jitter<br />
of giggles.<br />
In whispers<br />
of sun,<br />
mellow marrow<br />
tomorrow<br />
yonder years<br />
you wander.<br /></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Anniversary</strong></p>
<p>You have always been certain<br />
like the windows leak<br />
the warmth of a family,<br />
of children plodding&nbsp;<br />
with askew open arms<br />to embrace anyone<br />
during locked out<br />
winter nights...</p>

<p> You have always been sure <br />
that your light would<br />
attract someone <br />
in each second<br />
chewing away that chord<br />
you had bequeathed<br />
from the ancient pastures<br />
where ewes admire their<br />
penultimate stumbles. </p>

<p>Those glassy eyes,<br />
dripping, overflowing<br />
with yearn would<br />
yield to anyone, now,<br />
who bends over<br />
with the careless spine<br />
of a candle.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Afternoon at St John's</strong></p>

<p>As if nothing has happened.<br />
The light bulbs flicker,<br />
Grains of sugar sink<br />
in the cup, bitter as ever.<br />
The waitress bends over<br />
behind the counter.<br />
Cars hooted as they passed.<br />
I have already paid.<br /><br /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Floating</strong></p>
<p>Rattle of blades has quieted.<br />
"Check canopy!" uttered one.<br />
Just whisper of low clouds.<br />
Light rolled on mushy lips.<br />
Rays pronounced slowly.</p>
