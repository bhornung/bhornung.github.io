    "We create a source agnostic interface that yields data to a pipeline.\n",

    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "Data can be loaded from a variety of sources, files on hard drive, from a database, as a stream from a sensor. Each of these resources require a different set of rules to extract the data from them. When constructing a data pipeline, we can easily end up writing custom handler, each being slightly different, depending on the project we are working on. Even worse, the subsequent stages of the data pipeline would explicitly depend on the specifications of the handler. \n",
    "\n",
    "A common solution is to write interfaces with highly abstracted functionalities, where an interface\n",
    "* belongs to a program unit that performs a generic task _i.e._ consuming the contents of the resource\n",
    "* has a standardised and preferably intuitive signature.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Specifications\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we set out to write a handler, it is important to define a set of requirements that will guide us throughout the implementation. Having the specifications will also help us to quantify the work and progress that we will have done.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following we create a data handler which has the following methods\n",
    "\n",
    "* `open_resource` opens and connects to a resource\n",
    "* `get_one` returns one unit of data\n",
    "* `get_all` returns all data units\n",
    "* `close_resource` disconnects from and closes the resource\n",

    "    * The `open` method decides how wehther to treat the file as binary of text.\n",
    "* The `close` method is empty for the open context manager closes the file when it finds appropriate\n",
    "* There is a mild danger however. If one uses `get_one` and then `get_all`, the former method only consumes the what is left of the generator, but not the entire file. It would be easy to fix this by calling `open` again from inside `get_all`. However, we keep the class simple for demonstration purposes."

    "* As an option, the wrappers around `get_one` and `get_all` could be removed in the `ResourceHandlerBaseclass2`, if we are confident the resource field is always the source of the data.\n",

    "## Summary and prospects\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### What have we achieved?\n",
    "\n",
    "We created a resource handler that \n",
    "* serves either a datum by calling the `get_one()` method\n",
    "* or all data by calling the `get_all()` method\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Was it worth the time?\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, the rest of our application is detached from the source and handling of the incoming data. The only thing we have to remember is to call one of the methods above whenever needed inside our pipeline. The rest of the pipeline is agnostic whence the data sourced. The handler is not interested thence the data go.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What can be done next?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two directions of further abstracting the handler utilities\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Wrap data source\n",
    "\n",
    "The signature of the base class, allow us to\n",
    "* create a data source inside the handler _e.g._ open a file in `FileHandler2`, attach to a database\n",
    "* connect to a stream as in `BufferedResourceHandler`\n",
    "\n",
    "If we choose the latter option, it is possible to pass argument to the `open_resource` method which prescribe the way to connect to the stream _e.g._ one can pass keyword argument which specifies which method of the stream should be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Class factory\n",
    "\n",
    "Nothing prevents us from writing a class factory that dynamically creates handler classes inherited from the base class. If we work with an established code base, that its utilities can be used as off-the-shelf components to populate the fields of the dynamically created class."
