## Education

I received my MsC (with honours) in chemistry in 2009. I specialised in physical organometallic chemistry which involved the preparation and measurement of various arsenic, antimony,bismuth compounds, and publishing a [cover paper](https://pubs.acs.org/toc/jpcafh/113/280).

I join the group of Professor Mark Brouard at the University of Oxford 2009, where I was awarded a DPhil in physical and theoretical chemistry in 2013. The research carried out focused on the scattering theory of triatomic systems. My DPhil thesis is available [here]().

## Work

The following years saw me as a postdoctoral researcher in the [group](http://www.bristoldynamics.com/who-are-we/) of Professor Andrew Orr-Ewing at the University of Bristol, where I worked as a theoretical-computational chemist to unravel reaction mechanisms.

In the beginning of 2017 I joined [Interactive Scientific Ltd](http://interactivescientific.com/), a Bristol based educational startup company. Initially in part time, later as a full time developer. My role there includes building tools for creating educational software, developing content and a dash of business intelligence.
In the same time I am visiting fellow at University of Bristol collaborating with my former group and the group of [Dr David Glowacky](https://group-wacky.com/).

## Interests

Most of the areas I am  interested in are related to science -- or, at least I try to link them together. These includes

* theoretical models of reaction dynamics
* statistics
* numerical algorithms
* machine learning has also become more emphasised over the past years

## Hobbies

If not busy with the list above, I enjoy walking in the UK and trekking in some less visited countries.
