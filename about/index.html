        <h1>About</h1>
	<p> Some information about me and my projects.</p>
	


<h2><a id="Education_0"></a>Education</h2>
<p>I received my MsC (with honours) in chemistry in 2009. I specialised in physical organometallic chemistry which involved the preparation and measurement of various arsenic, antimony,bismuth compounds, and publishing a <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/toc/jpcafh/113/280">cover paper</a>.</p>
<p>I join the group of Professor Mark Brouard at the University of Oxford 2009, where I was awarded a DPhil in physical and theoretical chemistry in 2013. The research carried out focused on the scattering theory of triatomic systems. My DPhil thesis is available <a href="">here</a>.</p>

<h2><a id="Work_6"></a>Work</h2>
<p>The following years saw me as a postdoctoral researcher in the <a href="http://www.bristoldynamics.com/who-are-we/">group</a> of Professor Andrew Orr-Ewing at the University of Bristol, where I worked as a theoretical-computational chemist to unravel reaction mechanisms.</p>
<p>In the beginning of 2017 I joined <a href="http://interactivescientific.com/">Interactive Scientific Ltd</a>, a Bristol based educational startup company. Initially in part time, later as a full time developer. My role there includes building tools for creating educational software, developing content and a dash of business intelligence.<br>
In the same time I am visiting fellow at University of Bristol collaborating with my former group and the group of <a href="https://group-wacky.com/">Dr David Glowacky</a>.</p>

<h2><a id="Interests_13"></a>Interests</h2>
<p>Most of the areas I am  interested in are related to science â€“ or, at least I try to link them together. These includes</p>
<ul>
<li>theoretical models of reaction dynamics</li>
<li>statistics</li>
<li>numerical algorithms</li>
<li>machine learning has also become more emphasised over the past years</li>
</ul>
<h2><a id="Hobbies_22"></a>Hobbies</h2>
<p>If not busy with the list above, I enjoy walking in the UK and trekking in some less visited countries.</p>
